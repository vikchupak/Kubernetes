# Exposing using an ingress-controller vs cloud load balancers directly

#  Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE)

- When you create a Kubernetes Service of type `LoadBalancer`, Linode provisions a Linode's `NodeBalancer` for your cluster.
- **Linode only provides the NodeBalancer, which operates at the TCP layer (Layer 4) and lacks advanced Layer 7 features like ALB.** Ingress Controller Is Required for ALB (7 Layer). Linode's NodeBalancer works only at Layer 4 (TCP) and does not support Kubernetes Ingress resources or advanced HTTP routing. As a result: If you want to handle HTTP traffic (e.g., host/path-based routing, SSL termination), you must deploy an Ingress Controller (e.g., NGINX or Traefik) in your cluster. The NodeBalancer forwards raw TCP/HTTP traffic to the Ingress Controller, which then handles the routing to services.
- The NodeBalancer automatically receives an external IP (public IP address) from Linode, which acts as the entry point for external traffic to your Kubernetes cluster.
- The external IP of the LoadBalancer service will be mapped to the NodeBalancer that Linode provisions.
- **In essence, Kubernetes does not directly assign an IP to the LoadBalancer service itself. Rather, the NodeBalancer is given the IP, and then it forwards traffic to the LoadBalancer service running inside your Kubernetes cluster.**
  - The NodeBalancer is acting as a reverse proxy to route external traffic to the k8s LoadBalancer Service.
- **From an external perspective, you will use the same IP address for both your NodeBalancer and  the k8s LoadBalancer Service because Linode's infrastructure binds the NodeBalancer to that IP address.**
- If you have multiple services of type LoadBalancer in Kubernetes (e.g., several services needing external access), Linode may provision multiple NodeBalancers, each with its own external IP

# AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)

AWS offers multiple types of load balancers with distinct features:

- Application Load Balancer (ALB): Works at the HTTP/HTTPS layer (Layer 7) and supports features like host/path-based routing.
- Network Load Balancer (NLB): Works at the TCP layer (Layer 4), ideal for high-performance, low-latency traffic.
- **Ingress Controller Is Optional**
   - AWS provides Application Load Balancer (ALB), which can directly interpret Kubernetes Ingress resources. This means:
    You donâ€™t need to deploy an Ingress Controller (like NGINX or Traefik) because ALB acts as the Ingress Controller.
  ALB supports advanced Layer 7 features such as host/path-based routing and SSL termination.
If you want more control (e.g., custom NGINX configurations), you can still deploy an Ingress Controller and configure an NLB or CLB to forward traffic to it.
- ALB itself acts as the Ingress Controller by interpreting Kubernetes Ingress resources.

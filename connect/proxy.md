kubectl proxy is a Kubernetes command and is not specific to Minikube. It creates a local proxy to the Kubernetes API server, allowing you to access the Kubernetes API and services securely from your local machine. 

---

- The `kubectl proxy` command creates a secure local HTTP proxy server that enables communication between your local machine and the Kubernetes `API server`. Typically bound to localhost (by default)
- Through the proxy, you can access and configure Kubernetes resources and services (e.g., the dashboard or custom APIs) securely without directly exposing the Kubernetes API server to external networks
  - **Cluster Configuration and Management**
  - Control Plane Communication
  - Access Control
  - Cluster State Management
  - **NOT for direct application traffic**
```bash
kubectl proxy [--port=80808]
```

`kubectl port-forward` forwards a local port to a pod or service, providing temporary access to the API.
```bash
kubectl port-forward pod/<pod-name> 8080:80
curl http://localhost:8080
```

## Why kubernetes-dashboard accessible via api server?

The Kubernetes Dashboard is accessible via the API server because it is designed as a Kubernetes-native application that interacts with the cluster through the same mechanisms as any other Kubernetes client (like `kubectl`). Here's why and how this works:

---

### **1. Centralized API Access**
The API server acts as the single point of communication for all cluster operations. It manages authentication, authorization, and resource access, ensuring secure and consistent control. The Dashboard uses the API server to:
- Query resources (e.g., Pods, Services, Deployments).
- Perform operations (e.g., scaling, creating, or deleting resources).
- Monitor cluster health and activity.

---

### **2. Security**
By routing all Dashboard traffic through the API server:
- **Authentication**: The API server ensures only authenticated users or service accounts can access the Dashboard.
- **Authorization**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies apply, restricting access based on user roles.
- **Audit Logging**: All Dashboard interactions are logged as API requests, providing visibility for debugging and security audits.

---

### **3. Simplified Architecture**
Since the Dashboard communicates directly with the API server:
- **No Custom Backend**: The Dashboard doesn't require its own backend service for accessing cluster resources. It uses the API server's existing mechanisms.
- **Cluster Integration**: The Dashboard is deployed as a standard Kubernetes application and relies on the API server for operations, just like any other application in the cluster.

---

### **4. Dynamic Access to Cluster Resources**
The API server provides a dynamic, real-time view of the cluster, allowing the Dashboard to:
- Display up-to-date information about cluster resources.
- Interact with all resources across namespaces without directly accessing them (everything is mediated by the API server).

---

### **5. Proxy Access**
By exposing the Dashboard through the API server proxy (e.g., `kubectl proxy`), it ensures:
- **Ease of Access**: Users don't need to expose the Dashboard service publicly. They can access it via `localhost` securely.
- **Isolation**: The Dashboard service doesn't need direct external exposure, reducing attack surface.

---

### **6. No Need for a Separate Communication Path**
Kubernetes is designed around the API server as the central hub. By making the Dashboard use the same API server:
- **Consistency**: It ensures all Kubernetes tools and UIs interact with the cluster in the same way.
- **Ease of Management**: Admins manage one endpoint (API server) rather than multiple interfaces for different tools.

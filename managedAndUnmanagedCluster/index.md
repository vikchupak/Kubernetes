## Cluster on On-promises
- **Spin up**
  - Create a cluster from a scratch. We need to create and manage everithing yourselves
    - Create and manage **master** and worker nodes.
- **Data persistance**
  - We need to create physical storage and make it available for the cluster
    - Create Persistent Volume
    - Attach the volumes to pods
- **Load balancing**
  - We need to install and run Ingress Controller to manage routing of incomming requests
    - Configure your routing rules
    - We can set up Ingress Controller as Load Balancer
      - Nginx inside controller can be used as load bancer

## Cluster on Cloud using Managed service
- **Spin up**
  - Most setup is automated and done by cloud provider
  - We select number of worker nodes and resouces on them with everything pre-installed
  - Master nodes are managed and created by cloud provider. So we only pay for worker nodes.
  - Select region/data center to decrease network latency
- **Data persistance**
  - We can use `Storage Class` to dynamicly provide storage by cloud provider
- **Load balancing**
  - Cloud providers provide their own Load Balancer implementations
    - **It stands in front of the Ingress controller**. In this scenario Ingress controller works as a "router".
    - The cloud load balancer routes external traffic to the Ingress Controller.
  - We can configure a session stickiness
  - We can set SSL/TLS Certification
- **Migration to another cloud**
  - Not easy at all as cloud providers provide a lof of cloud-specific features, though very similar.
    - Your apps get highly tied to a cloud provider
    - Re-programming and reconfiguring necessary
- **Automation**
  - Cloud providers provide access to their resouces via automation tools (Terraform, Ansible), which allows to automate your infrastructure/devops work

In Helm, the commands `install`, `uninstall`, `upgrade`, and `rollback` perform different functions related to the lifecycle of a Helm release:

### 1. **`helm install`**:
   - **Purpose**: Installs a new Helm release in your Kubernetes cluster.
   - **Usage**:  
     ```bash
     helm install <release-name> <chart> [flags]
     ```
   - **Example**:  
     ```bash
     helm install my-release nginx-ingress/ingress-nginx
     ```
   - **Description**: This command installs the specified chart as a new release. If a release with the same name already exists, it will fail.

### 2. **`helm uninstall`**:
   - **Purpose**: Removes an installed release from the cluster.
   - **Usage**:  
     ```bash
     helm uninstall <release-name> [flags]
     ```
   - **Example**:  
     ```bash
     helm uninstall my-release
     ```
   - **Description**: This will delete the release and all its associated Kubernetes resources (e.g., Deployments, Services).

### 3. **`helm upgrade`**:
   - **Purpose**: Upgrades an existing release to a new version of the chart or changes the configuration of a release.
   - **Usage**:  
     ```bash
     helm upgrade <release-name> <chart> [flags]
     ```
   - **Example**:  
     ```bash
     helm upgrade my-release nginx-ingress/ingress-nginx
     ```
   - **Description**: This command is used when you want to upgrade an existing release to a new version or apply new values to a release. If the release doesn't exist, it will fail (use `install` if it doesn't exist).

### 4. **`helm rollback`**:
   - **Purpose**: Rolls back an existing release to a previous revision.
   - **Usage**:  
     ```bash
     helm rollback <release-name> <revision> [flags]
     ```
   - **Example**:  
     ```bash
     helm rollback my-release 1
     ```
   - **Description**: This command is used to revert the release to a specific revision. Helm stores a history of the release versions, so you can rollback to any previous revision number.
